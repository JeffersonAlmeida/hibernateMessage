        The most important point about Hibernate and concurrency control is that it is very
        easy to understand. Hibernate directly uses JDBC connections and JTA resources without
        adding any additional locking behavior. We highly recommend you spend some time with the
        JDBC, ANSI, and transaction isolation specification of your database management system.
        Hibernate only adds automatic versioning but does not lock objects in memory or change the
        isolation level of your database transactions. Basically, use Hibernate like you would
        use direct JDBC (or JTA/CMT) with your database resources.
    </p><p>
        However, in addition to automatic versioning, Hibernate also offers a (minor) API for
        pessimistic locking of rows, using the <tt class="literal">SELECT FOR UPDATE</tt> syntax. This API
        is discussed later in this chapter.
    </p><p>
        We start the discussion of concurrency control in Hibernate with the granularity of
        <tt class="literal">Configuration</tt>, <tt class="literal">SessionFactory</tt>, and
        <tt class="literal">Session</tt>, as well as database and long application transactions.
    </p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="transactions-basics"></a>11.1.&nbsp;Session and transaction scopes</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            A <tt class="literal">SessionFactory</tt> is an expensive-to-create, threadsafe object 
            intended to be shared by all application threads. It is created once, usually on
            application startup, from a <tt class="literal">Configuration</tt> instance.
        </p><p>
            A <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is an inexpensive, non-threadsafe object that should be
            used once, for a single business process, a single unit of work, and then discarded.
            A <tt class="literal">Session</tt> will not obtain a JDBC <tt class="literal">Connection</tt>
            (or a <tt class="literal">Datasource</tt>) unless it is needed, so you may safely open
            and close a <tt class="literal">Session</tt> even if you are not sure that data access will
            be needed to serve a particular request. (This becomes important as soon as you are
            implementing some of the following patterns using request interception.)
        </p><p>
            To complete this picture you also have to think about database transactions. A
            database transaction has to be as short as possible, to reduce lock contention in
            the database. Long database transactions will prevent your application from scaling
            to highly concurrent load.
        </p><p>
            What is the scope of a unit of work? Can a single Hibernate <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
            span several database transactions or is this a one-to-one relationship of scopes? When
            should you open and close a <tt class="literal">Session</tt> and how do you demarcate the
            database transaction boundaries?
        </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-basics-uow"></a>11.1.1.&nbsp;Unit of work</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                First, don't use the <span class="emphasis"><em>session-per-operation</em></span> antipattern, that is,
                don't open and close a <tt class="literal">Session</tt> for every simple database call in
                a single thread! Of course, the same is true for database transactions. Database calls
                in an application are made using a planned sequence, they are grouped into atomic
                units of work. (Note that this also means that auto-commit after every single
                SQL statement is useless in an application, this mode is intended for ad-hoc SQL
                console work. Hibernate disables, or expects the application server to do so,
                auto-commit mode immediately.)
            </p><p>
                The most common pattern in a multi-user client/server application is
                <span class="emphasis"><em>session-per-request</em></span>. In this model, a request from the client
                is send to the server (where the Hibernate persistence layer runs), a new Hibernate
                <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is opened, and all database operations are executed in this unit
                of work. Once the work has been completed (and the response for the client has been prepared),
                the session is flushed and closed. You would also use a single database transaction to
                serve the clients request, starting and committing it when you open and close the
                <tt class="literal">Session</tt>. The relationship between the two is one-to-one and this
                model is a perfect fit for many applications.
            </p><p>
                The challenge lies in the implementation:  not only has the <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
                and transaction to be started and ended correctly, but they also have to be accessible for
                data access operations. The demarcation of a unit of work is ideally implemented using an
                interceptor that runs when a request hits the server and before the response will be send (i.e.
                a <tt class="literal">ServletFilter</tt>). We recommend to bind the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> to
                the thread that serves the request, using a <tt class="literal">ThreadLocal</tt> variable. This allows
                easy access (like accessing a static variable) in all code that runs in this thread. Depending
                on the database transaction demarcation mechanism you chose, you might also keep the transaction
                context in a <tt class="literal">ThreadLocal</tt> variable. The implementation patterns for this
                are known as <span class="emphasis"><em>ThreadLocal Session</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Open Session in View</em></span>.
                You can easily extend the <tt class="literal">HibernateUtil</tt> helper class shown earlier in this
                documentation to implement this. Of course, you'd have to find a way to implement an interceptor
                and set it up in your environment. See the Hibernate website for tips and examples.
             </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-basics-apptx"></a>11.1.2.&nbsp;Application transactions</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                The session-per-request pattern is not the only useful concept you can use to design
                units of work. Many business processes require a whole series of interactions with the user
                interleaved with database accesses. In web and enterprise applications it is
                not acceptable for a database transaction to span a user interaction. Consider the following
                example:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                        The first screen of a dialog opens, the data seen by the user has been loaded in
                        a particular <tt class="literal">Session</tt> and database transaction. The user is free to
                        modify the objects.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        The user clicks "Save" after 5 minutes and expects his modifications to be made
                        persistent; he also expects that he was the only person editing this information and
                        that no conflicting modification can occur.
                    </p></li></ul></div><p>
                We call this unit of work, from the point of view of the user, a long running
                <span class="emphasis"><em>application transaction</em></span>. There are many ways how you can implement
                this in your application.
            </p><p>
                A first naive implementation might keep the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> and database
                transaction open during user think time, with locks held in the database to prevent
                concurrent modification, and to guarantee isolation and atomicity. This is of course
                an anti-pattern, since lock contention would not allow the application to scale with
                the number of concurrent users.
            </p><p>
                Clearly, we have to use several database transactions to implement the application
                transaction. In this case, maintaining isolation of business processes becomes the
                partial responsibility of the application tier. A single application transaction
                usually spans several database transactions. It will be atomic if only one of
                these database transactions (the last one) stores the updated data, all others
                simply read data (e.g. in a wizard-style dialog spanning several request/response
                cycles). This is easier to implement than it might sound, especially if
                you use Hibernate's features:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

                        reattach the objects and persist the modifications, the pattern is called
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>session-per-request-with-detached-objects</em></span>. Automatic

                        is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>session-per-application-transaction</em></span> and makes
                        even reattachment unnecessary. Automatic versioning is used to isolate

                An application may concurrently access the same persistent state in two
                different <tt class="literal">Session</tt>s. However, an instance of a persistent class
                is never shared between two <tt class="literal">Session</tt> instances. Hence there are
                two different notions of identity:
            </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Database Identity</span></dt><dd><p>
                            <tt class="literal">foo.getId().equals( bar.getId() )</tt>
                        </p></dd><dt><span class="term">JVM Identity</span></dt><dd><p>
                            <tt class="literal">foo==bar</tt>
                        </p></dd></dl></div><p>
                Then for objects attached to a <span class="emphasis"><em>particular</em></span> <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
                (i.e. in the scope of a <tt class="literal">Session</tt>) the two notions are equivalent, and
                JVM identity for database identity is guaranteed by Hibernate. However, while the application
                might concurrently access the "same" (persistent identity) business object in two different
                sessions, the two instances will actually be "different" (JVM identity). Conflicts are
                resolved using (automatic versioning) at flush/commit time, using an optimistic approach.
            </p><p>
                This approach leaves Hibernate and the database to worry about concurrency; it also provides
                the best scalability, since guaranteeing identity in single-threaded units of work only doesn't
                need expensive locking or other means of synchronization. The application never needs to
                synchronize on any business object, as long as it sticks to a single thread per
                <tt class="literal">Session</tt>. Within a <tt class="literal">Session</tt> the  application may safely use
                <tt class="literal">==</tt> to compare objects.
            </p><p>
                However, an application that uses <tt class="literal">==</tt> outside of a <tt class="literal">Session</tt>,
                might see unexpected results. This might occur even in some unexpected places, for example,
                if you put two detached instances into the same <tt class="literal">Set</tt>. Both might have the same
                database identity (i.e. they represent the same row), but JVM identity is by definition not
                guaranteed for instances in detached state. The developer has to override the <tt class="literal">equals()</tt>
                and <tt class="literal">hashCode()</tt> methods in persistent classes and implement
                his own notion of object equality. There is one caveat: Never use the database
                identifier to implement equality, use a business key, a combination of unique, usually
                immutable, attributes. The database identifier will change if a transient object is made
                persistent. If the transient instance (usually together with detached instances) is held in a
                <tt class="literal">Set</tt>, changing the hashcode breaks the contract of the <tt class="literal">Set</tt>.
                Attributes for business keys don't have to be as stable as database primary keys, you only
                have to guarantee stability as long as the objects are in the same <tt class="literal">Set</tt>. See
                the Hibernate website for a more thorough discussion of this issue. Also note that this is not
                a Hibernate issue, but simply how Java object identity and equality has to be implemented.

                 Never use the anti-patterns <span class="emphasis"><em>session-per-user-session</em></span> or
                 <span class="emphasis"><em>session-per-application</em></span> (of course, there are rare exceptions to
                 this rule). Note that some of the following issues might also appear with the recommended
                 patterns, make sure you understand the implications before making a design decision:

                        A <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is not thread-safe. Things which are supposed to work
                        concurrently, like HTTP requests, session beans, or Swing workers, will cause race
                        conditions if a <tt class="literal">Session</tt> instance would be shared. If you keep your
                        Hibernate <tt class="literal">Session</tt> in your <tt class="literal">HttpSession</tt> (discussed
                        later), you should consider synchronizing access to your Http session. Otherwise,
                        a user that clicks reload fast enough may use the same <tt class="literal">Session</tt> in
                        two concurrently running threads.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        An exception thrown by Hibernate means you have to rollback your database transaction
                        and close the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> immediately (discussed later in more detail).
                        If your <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is bound to the application, you have to stop
                        the application. Rolling back the database transaction doesn't put your business
                        objects back into the state they were at the start of the transaction. This means the
                        database state and the business objects do get out of sync. Usually this is not a
                        problem, because exceptions are not recoverable and you have to start over after
                        rollback anyway.

                        The <tt class="literal">Session</tt> caches every object that is in persistent state (watched
                        and checked for dirty state by Hibernate). This means it grows endlessly until you
                        get an OutOfMemoryException, if you keep it open for a long time or simply load too
                        much data. One solution for this is to call <tt class="literal">clear()</tt> and <tt class="literal">evict()</tt>
                        to manage the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> cache, but you most likely should consider a
                        Stored Procedure if you need mass data operations. Some solutions are shown in
                        <a href="batch.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;13.&nbsp;Batch processing">Chapter&nbsp;13, <i>Batch processing</i></a>. Keeping a <tt class="literal">Session</tt> open for the duration
                        of a user session also means a high probability of stale data.

            Datatabase (or system) transaction boundaries are always necessary. No communication with
            the database can occur outside of a database transaction (this seems to confuse many developers
            who are used to the auto-commit mode). Always use clear transaction boundaries, even for
            read-only operations. Depending on your isolation level and database capabilities this might not
            be required but there is no downside if you always demarcate transactions explicitly.
        </p><p>
            A Hibernate application can run in non-managed (i.e. standalone, simple Web- or Swing applications)
            and managed J2EE environments. In a non-managed environment, Hibernate is usually responsible for
            its own database connection pool. The application developer has to manually set transaction
            boundaries, in other words, begin, commit, or rollback database transactions himself. A managed environment
            usually provides container-managed transactions, with the transaction assembly defined declaratively
            in deployment descriptors of EJB session beans, for example. Programmatic transaction demarcation is
            then no longer necessary, even flushing the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is done automatically.
        </p><p>
            However, it is often desirable to keep your persistence layer portable. Hibernate offers a wrapper
            API called <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt> that translates into the native transaction system of
            your deployment environment. This API is optional (using database transactions is not!) and you don't
            have to use it if database portability provided by Hibernate is all you need.
        </p><p>
            Usually, ending a <tt class="literal">Session</tt> involves four distinct phases:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>

            Flushing the session has been discussed earlier, we'll now have a closer look at transaction
            demarcation and exception handling in both managed- and non-managed environments.
        </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-demarcation-nonmanaged"></a>11.2.1.&nbsp;Non-managed environment</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                If a Hibernate persistence layer runs in a non-managed environment, database connections
                are either handled by Hibernate's pooling mechanism or provided by the developer (this
                case has other implications, esp. with regard to caching):
            </p><pre class="programlisting">// Session sess = factory.openSession(myConnection);
Session sess = factory.openSession();

try {
    // do some work
    ...
    sess.flush();
    sess.connection().commit();
}
catch (RuntimeException e) {
    sess.connection().rollback();
    throw e; // or display error message
}
finally {
    sess.close();
}</pre><p>
                Note that you will very likely never see this piece of code in a normal application;
                fatal (system) exceptions should always be caught at the "top". In other words, the
                code that executes Hibernate calls (in the persistence layer) and the code that handles
                <tt class="literal">RuntimeException</tt> (and usually can only clean up and exit) are in
                different layers. This can be a challenge to design yourself and you should use J2EE/EJB
                container services whenever they are available. Exception handling is discussed later in
                this chapter.
            </p><p>
                We recommend, even if persistence layer portability is not your primary concern, the
                <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt> API:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">Session sess = factory.openSession();
Transaction tx = null;
try {
    tx = sess.beginTransaction();

    // do some work
    ...

    tx.commit();
}
catch (RuntimeException e) {
    if (tx != null) tx.rollback();
    throw e; // or display error message
}
finally {
    sess.close();
}</pre><p>
                Note that you don't have to <tt class="literal">flush()</tt> the <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
                explicitly, the call to <tt class="literal">commit()</tt> automatically triggers the
                synchronization. This piece of code is now portable and runs in non-managed and JTA
                environments. See <a href="session-configuration.html#configuration-optional-transactionstrategy" title="3.4.5.&nbsp;Transaction strategy configuration">Section&nbsp;3.4.5, &#8220;Transaction strategy configuration&#8221;</a> for
                the configuration options of the <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt> API and how it can
                be mapped to the underlying resource transaction system.
            </p><p>
                A call to <tt class="literal">close()</tt> marks the end of a session. The main implication
                of <tt class="literal">close()</tt> is that the JDBC connection will be relinquished by the session.
                If you provided your own connection, <tt class="literal">close()</tt> returns a reference
                to it, so you can manually close it or return it to the pool. Otherwise <tt class="literal">close()
                </tt> returns it to the pool.
            </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-demarcation-jta"></a>11.2.2.&nbsp;Using JTA</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                If your persistence layer runs in an application server (e.g. behind EJB session beans),
                transaction boundaries are defined in deployment descriptors. Every datasource connection
                obtained by Hibernate will automatically be part of a global JTA transaction. Hibernate
                simply joins this transaction, or if a particular session bean method has no mandatory
                transaction, Hibernate will tell the application server to start and end a transaction
                directly. (The latter should be considered a very rare case and is offered for consistency
                reasons. Note that your container might not allow mixed CMT and BMT behavior.)
            </p><p>
                If you set the properties <tt class="literal">hibernate.transaction.flush_before_completion</tt>
                and <tt class="literal">hibernate.transaction.auto_close_session</tt> to <tt class="literal">true</tt>,
                Hibernate wil also automatically flush and close the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> for you.
                The only thing left is exception handling and rollback of the database transaction.
                Fortunately, even this happens automatically, since an unhandled <tt class="literal">RuntimeException</tt>
                thrown by a session bean method tells the container to set the global transaction to
                rollback.
            </p><p>
                In other words, all you have to do in a managed environment is to get a <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
                from the <tt class="literal">SessionFactory</tt> (usually bound to JNDI), do your data access
                work, and leave the rest to the container. Transaction boundaries are set declaratively in
                the deployment descriptors of your session bean.
            </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-demarcation-exceptions"></a>11.2.3.&nbsp;Exception handling</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                If the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> throws an exception (including any
                <tt class="literal">SQLException</tt>), you should immediately rollback the database
                transaction, call <tt class="literal">Session.close()</tt> and discard the
                <tt class="literal">Session</tt> instance. Certain methods of <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
                will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> leave the session in a consistent state. No
                exception thrown by Hibernate can be treated as recoverable. Ensure that the
                <tt class="literal">Session</tt> will be closed by calling <tt class="literal">close()</tt>
                in a <tt class="literal">finally</tt> block.
            </p><p>
                The <tt class="literal">HibernateException</tt>, which wraps most of the errors that
                can occur in a Hibernate persistence layer, is an unchecked exception (it wasn't
                in older versions of Hibernate). In our opinion, we shouldn't force the application
                developer to catch an unrecoverable exception at a low layer. In most systems, unchecked
                and fatal exceptions are only catched in one of the first frames of the method call
                stack (i.e. in higher layers) and an error message is presented to the application
                user (or some other appropriate action is taken). Note that Hibernate might also throw
                other unchecked exceptions (e.g. when detecting stale data in version checks) which are
                not a <tt class="literal">HibernateException</tt>. These are, again, not recoverable and
                appropriate action should be taken.
            </p><p>
		        A subtype of <tt class="literal">HibernateException</tt> is <tt class="literal">SQLException</tt>
		        which indicate a specific set of error conditions occuring while Hibernate
		        interacts with the database.
	        </p><p>
                For SQLExceptions thrown while interacting with the database, Hibernate will
                attempt to convert the error into a subclass of JDBCException.  The underlying
                SQLException is accessible by calling <tt class="literal">JDBCException.getCause()</tt>.
                Hibernate converts the SQLException into an appropriate JDBCException subclass
                based on the SQLExceptionConverter attached to the SessionFactory.  By default,
                the SQLExceptionConverter is defined by the configured dialect; however, it is
                also possible to plug in a custom implmentation (see the javadocs for the
                SQLExceptionConverterFactory class for details).  The standard JDBCException
                subtypes are:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>

            The only approach that is consistent with high concurrency and high
            scalability is optimistic concurrency control with versioning. Version
            checking uses version numbers, or timestamps, to detect conflicting updates
            (and to prevent lost updates). Hibernate provides for three possible approaches
            to writing application code that uses optimistic concurrency. The use cases
            we show are in the context of long application transactions but version checking
            also has the benefit of preventing lost updates in single database transactions.
        </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-optimistic-manual"></a>11.3.1.&nbsp;Application version checking</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                In an implementation without much help from Hibernate, each interaction with the
                database occurs in a new <tt class="literal">Session</tt> and the developer is responsible
                for reloading all persistent instances from the database before manipulating them.
                This approach forces the application to carry out its own version checking to ensure
                application transaction isolation. This approach is the least efficient in terms of
                database access. It is the approach most similar to entity EJBs.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">// foo is an instance loaded by a previous Session
session = factory.openSession();
Transaction t = session.beginTransaction();
int oldVersion = foo.getVersion();
session.load( foo, foo.getKey() ); // load the current state
if ( oldVersion!=foo.getVersion ) throw new StaleObjectStateException();
foo.setProperty("bar");
t.commit();
session.close();</pre><p>
                The <tt class="literal">version</tt> property is mapped using <tt class="literal">&lt;version&gt;</tt>,
                and Hibernate will automatically increment it during flush if the entity is
                dirty.
            </p><p>
                Of course, if you are operating in a low-data-concurrency environment and don't
                require version checking, you may use this approach and just skip the version
                check. In that case, <span class="emphasis"><em>last commit wins</em></span> will be the default
                strategy for your long application transactions. Keep in mind that this might
                confuse the users of the application, as they might experience lost updates without
                error messages or a chance to merge conflicting changes.
            </p><p>
                Clearly, manual version checking is only feasible in very trivial circumstances
                and not practical for most applications. Often not only single instances, but
                complete graphs of modified ojects have to be checked. Hibernate offers automatic
                version checking with either long <tt class="literal">Session</tt> or detached instances
                as the design paradigm.
            </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-optimistic-longsession"></a>11.3.2.&nbsp;Long session and automatic versioning</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                A single <tt class="literal">Session</tt> instance and its persistent instances are
                used for the whole application transaction. Hibernate checks instance versions
                at flush time, throwing an exception if concurrent modification is detected.
                It's up to the developer to catch and handle this exception (common options
                are the opportunity for the user to merge changes or to restart the business
                process with non-stale data).
            </p><p>
                The <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is disconnected from any underlying JDBC connection
                when waiting for user interaction. This approach is the most efficient in terms
                of database access. The application need not concern itself with version checking or
                with reattaching detached instances, nor does it have to reload instances in every
                database transaction.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">// foo is an instance loaded earlier by the Session
session.reconnect(); // Obtain a new JDBC connection
Transaction t = session.beginTransaction();
foo.setProperty("bar");
t.commit(); // End database transaction, flushing the change and checking the version
session.disconnect(); // Return JDBC connection </pre><p>
                The <tt class="literal">foo</tt> object still knows which <tt class="literal">Session</tt> it was
                loaded in. <tt class="literal">Session.reconnect()</tt> obtains a new connection (or you
                may supply one) and resumes the session. The method <tt class="literal">Session.disconnect()</tt> will disconnect the session from
                the JDBC connection and return the connection to the pool (unless you provided the
                connection). After reconnection, to force a version check on data you aren't updating, you
                may call <tt class="literal">Session.lock()</tt> with <tt class="literal">LockMode.READ</tt> on any
                objects that might have been updated by another transaction. You don't need to lock any
                data that you <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> updating.
            </p><p>
                This pattern is problematic if the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is too big to
                be stored during user think time, e.g. an <tt class="literal">HttpSession</tt> should
                be kept as small as possible. As the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is also the
                (mandatory) first-level cache and contains all loaded objects, we can probably
                use this strategy only for a few request/response cycles. This is indeed
                recommended, as the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> will soon also have stale data.
            </p><p>
                Also note that you should keep the disconnected <tt class="literal">Session</tt> close
                to the persistence layer. In other words, use an EJB stateful session bean to
                hold the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> and don't transfer it to the web layer (or
                even serialize it to a separate tier) to store it in the <tt class="literal">HttpSession</tt>.
            </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-optimistic-detached"></a>11.3.3.&nbsp;Detached objects and automatic versioning</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                Each interaction with the persistent store occurs in a new <tt class="literal">Session</tt>.
                However, the same persistent instances are reused for each interaction with the database.
                The application manipulates the state of detached instances originally loaded in another
                <tt class="literal">Session</tt> and then reattaches them using <tt class="literal">Session.update()</tt>,
                <tt class="literal">Session.saveOrUpdate()</tt>, or <tt class="literal">Session.merge()</tt>.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">// foo is an instance loaded by a previous Session
foo.setProperty("bar");
session = factory.openSession();
Transaction t = session.beginTransaction();
session.saveOrUpdate(foo); // Use merge() if "foo" might have been loaded already
t.commit();
session.close();</pre><p>
                Again, Hibernate will check instance versions during flush, throwing an
                exception if conflicting updates occured.
            </p><p>
                You may also call <tt class="literal">lock()</tt> instead of <tt class="literal">update()</tt>
                and use <tt class="literal">LockMode.READ</tt> (performing a version check, bypassing all
                caches) if you are sure that the object has not been modified.
            </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-optimistic-customizing"></a>11.3.4.&nbsp;Customizing automatic versioning</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                You may disable Hibernate's automatic version increment for particular properties and 
                collections by setting the <tt class="literal">optimistic-lock</tt> mapping attribute to 
                <tt class="literal">false</tt>. Hibernate will then no longer increment versions if the 
                property is dirty.
            </p><p>
                Legacy database schemas are often static and can't be modified. Or, other applications
                might also access the same database and don't know how to handle version numbers or
                even timestamps. In both cases, versioning can't rely on a particular column in a table.
                To force a version check without a version or timestamp property mapping, with a
                comparison of the state of all fields in a row, turn on <tt class="literal">optimistic-lock="all"</tt>
                in the <tt class="literal">&lt;class&gt;</tt> mapping. Note that this concepetually only works
                if Hibernate can compare the old and new state, i.e. if you use a single long
                <tt class="literal">Session</tt> and not session-per-request-with-detached-objects.
            </p><p>
                Sometimes concurrent modification can be permitted as long as the changes that have been
                made don't overlap. If you set <tt class="literal">optimistic-lock="dirty"</tt> when mapping the
                <tt class="literal">&lt;class&gt;</tt>, Hibernate will only compare dirty fields during flush.
            </p><p>
                In both cases, with dedicated version/timestamp columns or with full/dirty field
                comparison, Hibernate uses a single <tt class="literal">UPDATE</tt> statement (with an
                appropriate <tt class="literal">WHERE</tt> clause) per entity to execute the version check
                and update the information. If you use transitive persistence to cascade reattachment
                to associated entities, Hibernate might execute uneccessary updates. This is usually
                not a problem, but <span class="emphasis"><em>on update</em></span> triggers in the database might be
                executed even when no changes have been made to detached instances. You can customize
                this behavior by setting  <tt class="literal">select-before-update="true"</tt> in the
                <tt class="literal">&lt;class&gt;</tt> mapping, forcing Hibernate to <tt class="literal">SELECT</tt>
                the instance to ensure that changes did actually occur, before updating the row.
            </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="transactions-locking"></a>11.4.&nbsp;Pessimistic Locking</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            It is not intended that users spend much time worring about locking strategies. Its usually
            enough to specify an isolation level for the JDBC connections and then simply let the
            database do all the work. However, advanced users may sometimes wish to obtain
            exclusive pessimistic locks, or re-obtain locks at the start of a new transaction.
        </p><p>
            Hibernate will always use the locking mechanism of the database, never lock objects
            in memory!
        </p><p>
            The <tt class="literal">LockMode</tt> class defines the different lock levels that may be acquired
            by Hibernate. A lock is obtained by the following mechanisms:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>
                    <tt class="literal">LockMode.WRITE</tt> is acquired automatically when Hibernate updates or inserts

                </p></li><li><p>
                    <tt class="literal">LockMode.UPGRADE</tt> may be acquired upon explicit user request using
                    <tt class="literal">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</tt> on databases which support that syntax.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    <tt class="literal">LockMode.UPGRADE_NOWAIT</tt> may be acquired upon explicit user request using a
                    <tt class="literal">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE NOWAIT</tt> under Oracle.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    <tt class="literal">LockMode.READ</tt> is acquired automatically when Hibernate reads data
                    under Repeatable Read or Serializable isolation level. May be re-acquired by explicit user
                    request.
                </p></li><li><p>
            <tt class="literal">LockMode.NONE</tt> represents the absence of a lock. All objects switch to this
            lock mode at the end of a <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt>. Objects associated with the session
            via a call to <tt class="literal">update()</tt> or <tt class="literal">saveOrUpdate()</tt> also start out
            in this lock mode.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
            The "explicit user request" is expressed in one of the following ways:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>
                    A call to <tt class="literal">Session.load()</tt>, specifying a <tt class="literal">LockMode</tt>.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    A call to <tt class="literal">Session.lock()</tt>.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    A call to <tt class="literal">Query.setLockMode()</tt>.
                </p></li></ul></div><p>
            If <tt class="literal">Session.load()</tt> is called with <tt class="literal">UPGRADE</tt> or
            <tt class="literal">UPGRADE_NOWAIT</tt>, and the requested object was not yet loaded by
            the session, the object is loaded using <tt class="literal">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</tt>.
            If <tt class="literal">load()</tt> is called for an object that is already loaded with
            a less restrictive lock than the one requested, Hibernate calls
            <tt class="literal">lock()</tt> for that object.
        </p><p>
            <tt class="literal">Session.lock()</tt> performs a version number check if the specified lock
            mode is <tt class="literal">READ</tt>, <tt class="literal">UPGRADE</tt> or
            <tt class="literal">UPGRADE_NOWAIT</tt>. (In the case of <tt class="literal">UPGRADE</tt> or
            <tt class="literal">UPGRADE_NOWAIT</tt>, <tt class="literal">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</tt> is used.)
        </p><p>
            If the database does not support the requested lock mode, Hibernate will use an appropriate
            alternate mode (instead of throwing an exception). This ensures that applications will
            be portable.
